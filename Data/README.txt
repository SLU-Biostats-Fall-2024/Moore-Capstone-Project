This study investigated the effect of climate on wild nestling superb fairy-wrens development as determined by telomere length. This study provides information that can be applied to research of the potential effects of climate change on species fitness. The data was collected in Australia by researchers from Monash University, French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, University of Groningen, and Australian National University, and was published in 2023. 

The following column key is taken from the original data set. There were no changes made to the original data set attached. 
# = Row number
Bird = Unique bird identification number
rTL = Relative telomere length
Tmax.nestling = Mean daily maximum temperature 
Tmin.nestling = Mean daily minimum temperature 
T35.nestling = Frequency of days >=35C during the nestling phase
T35.nestling.yn = Maximum daily temperature >=35C at least once during the nestling phase. Yes = 1, no = 0.
Rainfall.nestling = Total daily rainfall during the nestling phase
Tmax.pre = mean daily maximum temperature over a 19-day period between 25 and 6 days prior to telomere measurement
Rainfall.pre = Total daily rainfall over a 44-day period between 57 and 13 days prior to telomere measurement
Tvar.nestling = Mean difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the nestling period
HatchMonth = Month individual hatched
Sex = Sex of nestling M = male, F = female
ChickAge = Age in days
BodyMass = Mass of nestling at time of measurement
BroodSize = Number of nestlings in brood
HelpersYesNo = Helpers present = 1, or absent = 0 in territory
NestID = Unique nest identification number
Mother = Unique mother identification number
True.sire = Unique genetic father identification number
qPCRrun = Unique qPCR plate identification number
Cohort = Year individual hatched
